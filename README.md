# Sentimental Analysis on IGN-Reviews

This repo contains code that is able to extract Video Games reviews from IGN's website then perform sentiment analysis using Beautiful Soup.

There's 3 sentiment analysis models being used:
* Hu and Lui
* NRC
* Vader

The end result is a dataframe containing the metadata of each review url and the sentiment scores across all the models, saved to CSV.
